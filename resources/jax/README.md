**JAX-related Glossary**

**JAX basics for machine learning**

Most tutorials can be found on [https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/index.html](JAX 101 documentation) and [https://theaisummer.com/jax/](AISummer) article.

Below are they key JAX features used in machine learning. 

1) JIT (Just-in-time compilation)
2) Autograd (Auto differentiation with grad)
3) Auto vectorization with vmap()
4) Auto parallelization with pmap()
5) Pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)

**Demo: NLP Model with JAX**

To reduce hardware complexity, we installed jax and most of the support packages for GPU (CONDA, cuDNN) in the colab.
- CUDA version 11.2
- Python 3.7.15
