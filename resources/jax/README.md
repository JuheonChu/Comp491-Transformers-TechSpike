This document puts together our learning of JAX.

## JAX basics for machine learning

Most tutorials can be found on [JAX 101 documentation](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/index.html) and [AISummer](https://theaisummer.com/jax/) article.

Below are they key JAX features used in machine learning. 

1) JIT (Just-in-time compilation)
2) Autograd (Auto differentiation with grad)
3) Auto vectorization with vmap()
4) Auto parallelization with pmap()
5) Pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)

To reduce hardware complexity, we installed jax and most of the support packages for GPU (CONDA, cuDNN) in the colab.
- CUDA version 11.2
- Python 3.7.15
